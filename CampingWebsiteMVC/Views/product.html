            <p>
                Features
                <br>Freestanding design enables the tent to stand on its own without pegs—useful for hard ground, platforms or for moving your tent to a new site without taking it down.
                Super-strong aluminum frame creates a surprising amount of room inside; dual doors and vestibules eliminate the need to crawl over your tent mates when entering or exiting.
                Semi-geodesic prevents the tent from twisting and provides additional stability in the wind and also increases internal headroom.
                Upper expel vents and mesh inner tent promote air circulation to minimize condensation buildup.
                Front and rear vestibules offer additional storage or one wet/dry access and one storage area, and provide covered space to remove wet-weather gear or brush off dirt or sand.
                360° fold-away inner door allows the entire door to be unzipped and folded neatly into a corner pocket, with fully opening mesh panel.
                Poles are color-coordinated with their webbing end fittings, making it simple to find where each pole belongs; hi-vis colored webbing loops help you find front of the fly.
                Fly features clip-on attachment—simpler and more durable than pole sleeves, these sturdy plastic clips attach the inner tent securely to the frame.
                Adjustable straps at each peg point allow you to easily tighten and fine tune the tension of your rainfly; cam lock sliders let you adjust guy ropes.
                All seams in the rainfly are sealed with polyurethane tape to eliminate leak points from the stitching holes, ensuring your tent is ready for any weather.
                Separate fly sheet reduces condensation in the inner tent and can be removed for maximum ventilation on hot summer nights.
                Heavy-duty poly Oxford provides a hard-wearing floor surface for pitching on rough ground; waterproof, anti-draft tub floor extends up tent sides to prevent pooling water.

                <br>3-person layer includes 2 doors for separate and easy access; 2 vestibules offer occupants plenty of sheltered space to stash gear outside the tent.
                Bathtub floor construction keeps the water out during wet weather; floor features fully taped seams.
                UV-resistant polyester rainfly doesn't stretch or expand when wet, ensuring a consistently taut pitch.
                Fly roof vent keeps rain out while allowing hot air to vent, and no-see-um mesh panels in tent body offer excellent airflow to prevent condensation inside the tent.
                Interior mesh storage pockets keep small items organized and easy to find; includes a detachable ceiling loft pocket.
                Speed clip-to-pole attachment, grommet pole attachment and color-coded buckle attachments allow easy setup.
                Aluminum poles are strong and durable, while the pole clips make setup fast.

                Features
                <br>The Copper Spur HV UL3 Long 3-person tent gives you 8 in. of extra length plus 3–4 in. of extra height.
                Awning-style vestibules expand covered living space, which is great for both drizzle and sun protection.
                3D bin "mezzanine" in the foot provides massive, off-the-floor storage; oversized ceiling pocket in the head; media pockets provide earbud cord-routing.
                Tent corner construction with TipLok Tent Buckle™ design streamlines and combines 3 functions: secure pole-tip capture, rainfly attachment and tensioner, and stake-out loop.
                TipLok buckles have a keyed hole to securely lock pole tip in place during setup; hinged design stabilizes structure by equalizing forces between tent body, rainfly and stake.
                Lightweight double ripstop nylon; mixed-denier fabric offers extra tear-strength and puncture-resistance without adding weight.
                2 doors and 2 vestibules with double zippers provide multiple access options, letting you minimize wind-driven rain or snow getting into the tent.
                Dual low-vent vestibule door coupled with high-fly vent maximizes options for both active and passive airflow, reducing condensation in all weather conditions.

                Features
                <br>The Good Night's Sleep temperature rating is based on laboratory and cold-chamber testing, plus extensive experience manufacturing sleeping bags for use in extreme conditions.
                GORE-TEX® INFINIUM™ 10-denier outer shell is durable but light, exceptionally breathable and highly protective against snow and the effects of condensation.
                GORE-TEX INFINIUM 10-denier inner footbox and hood lining
                35 oz. of 800-fill-power goose down with a minimum down/feather ratio of 90/10 is sourced from a traceable and Down Codex® approved small-scale European supply chain.
                Expedition fit with EXL® system is both roomier and has improved loft and thermal efficiency.
                With a more generous fit that is longer and wider, it affords greater comfort when used for long periods of time; additional clothing can be worn or stored within the bag.
                Vertically aligned V-baffles on the chest and foot piece; 14:7cm trapezoid baffles throughout all other parts of the bag.
                Ground-level side seams provide maximum thermal efficiency by increasing the surface volume of the top-half and ensuring sidewalls can wrap uninterrupted around the main body.
                7-baffle, low-volume anatomically shaped hood provides exceptional down control for long-lasting performing insulation.
                The DC7 LV hood minimizes weight, has less deformation when cinched down small and offers single-handed closure easy-run drawcords.
                6-baffle anatomically shaped footbox features BullsEye™ technology and offset Sharks Toe™ foot construction to maximize thermal efficiency.
                Full-length Gemini™ zip baffle and integrated collar with Lode Lock™ closure.
                The Lode Lock system with its low-profile, auto-locating closure combines all the advantages of a magnetic fastener with those of a mechanical lock.
                Its one-handed, quick-release closure uses 2 captivated internal magnets to draw the locking mechanism together and ensure that once connected it cannot be accidentally opened.

            <p>
                Features
                <br>A 800FP goose down sleeping bag with a recycled, wind resistant Pertex® Quantum outer. Designed with a narrow mummy fit, for reduced bulk and pack size, and constructed with lightweight, high performance materials. It’s perfect for three season mountain missions.
                The Neutrino 400 is filled with 400g of 800FP, goose down, stabilised in chevron shaped baffles, cleverly designed to reduce the amount of fabric needed compared to traditional horizontal baffles. The trapezoid boxwall baffle construction allows the down to fully loft, eliminates cold spots, and maximises warmth. Additional baffles along the length of the zip and around the neck decrease heat loss, and with an adjustable drawcord around the hood you can cinch the bag around your face.
                Now built with a recycled nylon lining and recycled Pertex® Quantum outer, it’s wind resistant and a little lighter on the planet too. The down is also finished with a Nikwax, fluorocarbon-free hydrophobic treatment for coping with condensation. It has a ¾ length zip with anti-snag zip guards, a zipped internal stash pocket and comes with a waterproof roll-top compression sack for easy stashing.
                Hand-filled in the UK, all our down bags benefit from never having had their down compressed before use, maintaining the down’s loft and warmth.

                Features
                <br>This women-specific version features more insulation than the unisex version; it is also shorter, as well as wider between the hips and knees for a natural sleeping position.
                Air Sprung Cells™ provide support and comfort by more evenly dispersing pressure across the mat's surface.
                Dual-density layers of Thermolite® insulation fill the Air Sprung Cells and prevent internal air movement and convection heat loss.
                40-denier/30-denier ripstop nylon face fabric offers the right balance between weight and durability.
                Antimicrobial treatment added to the TPU helps prevent mold issues caused by warm, moist air trapped inside the mat.
                Patent-pending multifunction valve and included Airstream Pump™/stuff sack mean quick and easy inflation, deflation and adjustment.
                PillowLock system secures your Aeros™ pillow (not included) to your mat.

                Features
                <br>6.5 R-value is perfect for cold-weather adventures.
                Includes a multifunction single valve designed specifically for self-inflating mats—no more fighting re-inflation as you try to roll up your mat.
                Features Delta Core technology that creates a flat sleeping surface.
                Luxurious 30-denier stretch knit fabric provides a soft next-to-skin feeling on top.
                Robust and durable 75-denier polyester with extrusion-laminated TPU is used on the base.
                Large horizontal triangular cores reduce the weight and bulk without sacrificing support and comfort; large 4 in. sidewalls create a full-width flat sleeping surface.
                Polyurethane foam is thicker on top of each Delta Core for better insulation directly under you.
                Additional thickness keeps top and bottom surfaces of foam intact, ensuring consistent warmth along the entire length of the mat and better bonding with shell fabrics.
                Diagonal supporting foam walls help inflate the mattress and create a more compact rolled mat.

                <br>4.7 R-value is perfect for year-round adventures.
                Exkin Platinum® insulation reflects your radiant heat back to you; Thermolite® insulation prevents convective heat loss.
                The dual-chamber design means there's no top-to-bottom air movement, which reduces warmth transfer from the upper to the lower side of the mat.
                2 layers of XT Air-Sprung Cells provide unparalleled support plus redundancy in case of damage to 1 layer.
                You can make your lower level Air-Sprung Cell firm for protection against the uneven ground, then fine-tune the upper level to your personal comfort preference.
                Tough 30-denier/40-denier face fabric with lamination technology is quiet, durable and reliable.
                Multifunction valve offers quick and easy inflation, deflation and adjustment;
                Comes with an Airstream Pump™ sack, which functions as both pump and a stuff sack.
                PillowLock™ prevents your Sea to Summit Aeros™ pillow from slipping (pillow not included).

                Features
                <br>Provides over 4 in. of expansive, plush thickness, yet packs to half the size of other pads and is significantly lighter.
                Creates a level sleeping surface on all sorts of bumpy, rough terrain.
                Premium 50-denier stretch fabric offers a soft, cozy top; 75-denier polyester provides go-anywhere durability on the bottom.
                Both fabrics are made from bluesign®-certified 100% postconsumer recycled materials.
                Innovative Flow Core™ construction with high-volume air channels and strategic valve placement provides incredibly fast self-inflation and deflation.
                Unobtrusive Laylow™ valves include a multifunction, micro-adjust valve for custom inflation and a one-way dump valve for fast deflation and pack-up.
                Packs down to the size of a shoebox and comes with an oversize storage bag for easier packing.
                Included Vortex™ pump sack allows additional inflation.
                Includes toggles so you can connect pads together—toggling 2 Roamer™ XL Wide sleeping pads (additional pad not included) together creates a queen-size mattress.
                NEMO offers a lifetime warranty on this pad.

                Features
                <br>Handle Bit Storage - Conveniently store Leatherman tool bits in the handle of your multi-tool for easy access in the middle of a job, or for safe keeping when not in use.
                Locking Blade - A knife blade that locks into place when fully deployed. A user must manually unlock the blade to fold it away, which allows for a much safer user experience.
                Replaceable Pocket Clip - A removable clip which allows the user to wear their multi-tool attached to a pocket or belt loop without the use of a sheath. By removing the clip, the user is able to easily carry their tool in a sheath if preferred.
                Outside-accessible Features - This multi-tool features tools that are accessible while the tool is in its folded or closed position, mimicking the functionality of a pocket knife.
                One-hand Operable Features - Every feature on this tool can be opened and operated with one hand. This enables the user to keep the other hand free for situations that require multi-tasking or a free hand.
                25-year Warranty - Leatherman take extraordinary measures to ensure that your Leatherman product will give you many years of dependable service. If it doesn't, we will gladly replace it, at our discretion, with one of equal or greater value under our 25-year guarantee for tools. This warranty does not cover abuse, alteration, theft, loss, or unauthorised and/or unreasonable use of your Leatherman product. This warranty does not cover sheaths, accessories, imprinting, colour finishes, cleaning, or sharpening.

                Lock function prevents the headlamp from turning on during transit or storage, as well as allowing you to lock lighting settings during your activity.
                Battery pack is located in the rear to distribute the weight of the headlamp over your entire head, making it balanced and comfortable to wear.
                Lithium-ion 3200 mAh battery is rechargeable with a type C USB port; the battery can be also used as a spare to charge other devices, such as phones and watches.
                Battery charge indicator has a 5-level gauge for precise monitoring
                Charging time of 3.5 hrs.

                Features
                <br>Dual-fuel design allows you to power the headlamp with 3 AAA alkaline batteries (included) or the rechargeable BD 1500 lithium-ion battery and charger (not included).
                Settings include proximity and distance modes, dimming, strobe, red LED night vision, and lock mode.
                White LED outputs up to 400 lumens on max setting, 200 lumens on medium and 6 lumens on low.
                PowerTap™ Technology allows instant adjustment between max output and dimmed power.
                Brightness Memory allows you to turn the light on and off at a chosen brightness setting without it reverting back to the default setting.
                Red LED night vision has dimming and strobe modes, and is quickly activated without cycling through the white mode.
                IPX8 waterproof protection rated to operate at least 1.1 meters underwater for 30 minutes—perfect should you be caught in a downpour.
                If submerged, water may enter the battery compartment, but it will still operate; it should be completely dried out after use in wet conditions.
